# CLI Calculator

**CLI Calculator** is a command-line tool implemented in various programming languages. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are implemented across different languages. Each version of the calculator supports input from users via the terminal, processes the input, and returns the result.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: The calculator supports four primary operations:

  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)

- **Input**: The user is prompted to enter two numbers and the desired operation.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for invalid inputs (such as dividing by zero).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m-mdy-m/Cli-Calculator.git
cd Cli-Calculator
```
